# Cancer-detection-model
This project aims to detect cancer using machine learning techniques by analysing patient data (e.g., histopathological images, gene expression, or tabular clinical data). The goal is to assist early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

Features
Supports classification between benign and malignant tumours
Built using Python, scikit-learn, and/or TensorFlow/PyTorch
Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model saving
Supports visualisation of performance metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curve)
Optionally includes a simple GUI or API for deployment


pls note it's still in testing phase and gives response based on images provided from the  dataset, and is not given with accuracy results, may vary.
