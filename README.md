# Cancer-detection-model
This project aims to detect cancer using machine learning techniques by analyzing patient data (e.g., histopathological images, gene expression, or tabular clinical data). The goal is to assist early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

Features
Supports classification between benign and malignant tumors
Built using Python, scikit-learn, and/or TensorFlow/PyTorch
Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model saving
Supports visualization of performance metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curve)
Optionally includes a simple GUI or API for deployment
